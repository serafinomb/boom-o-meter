### GitHub Pages Deployment

1. **Fork this repository**

2. **Update `vite.config.js`**:
   ```javascript
   export default defineConfig({
     base: '/your-repository-name/', // Change this to your repo name
     // ... rest of config
   ```

3. **Enable GitHub Pages**:
   - Go to repository Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Source: "GitHub Actions"

4. **Push to main branch**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

5. **Access your app**:
   - Your app will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/your-repository-name/`

## üìã Usage

### Quick Start
1. Set your flash's Guide Number in settings
2. Choose your photography mode (Digital/Analog)
3. Set target distance with the slider
4. Select from suggested aperture/power combinations
5. Use the Quick Power Reference for at-a-glance power levels

### Settings Configuration
- **Guide Number**: Enter your flash's GN (usually 30-60 for speedlights)
- **Photography Mode**: 
  - Digital: ISO controls on main screen
  - Analog: Fixed ISO setting in preferences
- **Available Apertures**: Select which f-stops you use
- **Distance Range**: Set your typical shooting distances
- **Priority Weights**: Adjust recommendations (efficiency/DOF/accuracy)

## üßÆ Flash Calculation Formula

The app uses the standard flash photography formula:
```
Distance = (Guide Number √ó ‚àö(ISO/100) √ó ‚àö(Power)) / Aperture
```

## üé® Features in Detail

### Distance-First Workflow
Unlike traditional flash calculators that require you to input power and aperture first, this app lets you:
1. Set your desired shooting distance
2. See all viable power/aperture combinations
3. Choose based on your priorities (battery life, depth of field, etc.)

### Smart Recommendations
- **Optimal**: Best overall recommendation
- **Perfect**: Low power + deep depth of field
- **Efficient**: Battery-saving power levels
- **Max DOF**: Highest f-numbers available
- **Deep DOF**: Good depth of field options

### Quick Power Reference
Dynamic table showing:
- Your configured apertures (rows)
- Your distance range (columns)
- Color-coded power level bars
- Real-time calculations based on current ISO and GN
